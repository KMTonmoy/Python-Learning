This repository is created as part of my journey to learn Python programming.

It contains simple practice scripts, small projects, and exercises.  
There is no important or production-level data in this repo â€” everything here is for learning purposes only.

## What's Inside

- Basic Python syntax and concept demos  
- Practice problems and solutions  
- Mini projects for hands-on experience  
- Notes and helpful links

## Purpose

The goal of this repository is to document and organize my progress as I continue exploring Python. It serves as a personal reference and a space to experiment.
